<b>Legit folder</b><br />
In the collector mailbox create a separed folder using your MS Outlook, webmail or other IMAP client.<br />
e.g. "GOOD folder"<br />
Place all legit (HAM) emails you want to allow in this folder (invoices, payments etc).<br />
Scrollout F1 will connect via IMAP service to collector mailbox, fetch, learn and allow all emails from GOOD folder.<br />
i.e.:<br />
<li>GOOD</li>
<li>Inbox.GOOD in case is a subfolder under Inbox folder</li>
