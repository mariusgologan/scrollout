<b>Mailbox</b><br />
First, Scrollout F1 will quarantine junk emails to this address.<br />
Second, It will connect via IMAP to this mailbox, fetch and learn:
<li>Legit emails and whitelist sender domain from Mailbox Legit Folder</li>
<li>Spam emails and blacklist sender address from Mailbox Spam Folder</li>
<br />
Create a mailbox on your real email server and input the address here.<br />
i.e.: spam.collector@mydomain.com.<br />
Connect or attach the collector mailbox to your MS Outlook client or other IMAP email client.<br />
You may use a web-mail GUI or even an external mailbox on yahoo.com or gmail.com (not recommended).
