<b>Lite DLP</b><br />
Is a small tool that prevents certain files from being sent out from a company via email.<br />
This feature is for managers and team leaders, not for IT staff exclusively.<br />
<br />
Here is how it works:<br />
<li> Create a folder on a Windows file server or PC Workstation: \\intranet\dlp <br />
<?= (!empty($values['file_server']) && !empty($values['share'])) ? ('in this case the \\\\intranet\\dlp is \\\\' . $values['file_server'] . '\\' . $values['share'] . '<br /><br />') : '' ?></li> 

<li> Share that folder (shared folder: "dlp").<br />
<?= !empty($values['share']) ? ('in this case the \\dlp is \\' . $values['share'] . '<br /><br />') : '' ?></li> 

<li> Provide full permissions for the account used here 
<?= !empty($values['user_domain']) ? ($values['user_domain'] . '\\') : '' ?><?= !empty($values['folder_username']) ? $values['folder_username'] : '' ?>.</li> 
<li> Provide write permissions for Group Account(s) which includes managers and team leaders.</li> 
<li> Scrollout will create two folders: \\intranet\dlp\lock and \\intranet\dlp\unlock</li> 
<li> Managers, team leaders or IT staff can copy files in LOCK folder in order to prevent them to be sent outside the company.</li> 
<li> Scrollout will fetch and block any files copied in LOCK folder.</li> 
<li> It will unblock the files in UNLOCK folder.</li> 
<br />
Limitation: if the file has been modified, will pass through.
