                                <li> They may charge fees when limits are reached, but not retroactively.</li>

                                You may use internal DNS server to train spam detection (for few days after initial installation) or
                                when spam detection is poor.<br/>
                                With Training Days option, you can select when to use internal DNS and improve Bayes training.<br/>
