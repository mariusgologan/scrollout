<b>Trust networks</b><br />
Input one or more subnets in CIDR format to allow relay and sign with DKIM.
<br />
Important: Do not trust your router/firewall by including its IP here.<br/>
By doing that, you will open a relay to Internet world.<br />
<ul>Examples:</ul>
<ul>72.150.150.1/32,72.1.1.0/24</ul>
<ul>!72.1.1.1/32,72.1.1.0/24</ul>
<ul>Last example above allows any IP in 72.1.1.0/24, except 72.1.1.1</ul>
