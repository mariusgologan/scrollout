<b>IPSec</b><br/>
<br/>
Is an integral part of the security model of IPv6 and is the only solution for IP to IP encryption, at the present time.<br/>
<br/>
Benefits: <br/>
<ul>
data integrity (checksum), data confidentiality (encryption), data origin authentication (spoofing protection).<br/>
Scrollout uses IPSec, with AES 256 bit algorithm and PFS, to encrypt TCP port 25 (default) or any custom TCP port.<br/>
(on top of the existing SMTP with TLS)</ul>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
<ul>
Pros: offers a good protection against hackers attempting MITM and REPLAY attacks.<br/>
Pros: This is an IP to IP (HOST to HOST) transport encryption, not a VPN tunnel:<br/>
communications between machines behind Scrollout gateways are not possible.<br/>
Pros: Clean configuration, with no predefined default keys that can be exploited and used as backdoors..<br/>
Pros: Compatible with Microsoft Windows IPSec.</ul>
<ul>
Cons: Old (but not outdated), too complex and poorly documented to become widely adopted.<br/>
Cons: Is not considered a guaranteed/proof solution against ANY traffic interception method.</ul>
<br/>

IPSec Levels:<br/>
<ul>
